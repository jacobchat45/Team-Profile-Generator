# Team-Profile-Generator

This is a command-line application ran with Node.JS, allowing you to create a webpage containing cards with your employee details.

## Installation

Ensure you have npm & inquirer installed.

## Usage

Run index.js in your terminal, and you'll be prompted with an application which will allow you to build your team. Once you have finished, the programme will generate an "output" folder containing a webpage where you can view these details!

## Credits

I've used some code from my course teacher Dan Mueller as well as writing it with some guidance from a tutor.
